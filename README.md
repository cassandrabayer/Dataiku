# Dataiku
This is a quick project to review 1994-1995 Census Data. The goal of the project is to develop a model that can predict whether or not a respondent makes more or less than $50,000 per year.

## Instructions
Navigate to the repo folder and run the `modelingAnalysis.Rmd` file. This file will call upon the data shared. The .rmd will also source a controller with necessary libraries and custom functions.
