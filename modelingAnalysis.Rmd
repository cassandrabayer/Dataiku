Make a quick statistic based and univariate audit of the different columns’ content and produce the results in visual / graphic format. This audit should describe the variable distribution, the % of missing values, the extreme values, and so on.
```{r}


```

Create a model using these variables (you can use whichever variables you want, or even create you own; for example, you could find the ratio or relationship between different variables, the one-hot encoding of “categorical” variables, etc.) to model wining more or less than $50,000 / year. Here, the idea would be for you to test one or two algorithms, such as logistic regression, or a decision tree. Feel free to choose others if wish.
```{r}
summary(cars)
```

Choose the model that appears to have the highest performance based on a comparison between reality (the 42nd variable) and the model’s prediction. 
```{r}
```

Apply your model to the test file and measure it’s real performance on it (same method as above).
```{r}


```


Find clear insights on the profiles of the people that make more than $50,000 / year. For example, which variables seem to be the most correlated with this phenomenon?
```{r}


```

Describe steps and methodology
```{r}

```

Describe challenges
```{r}

```
